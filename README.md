# IP_Toolbox_v2
A redesigned app with new architecture and backend database

The app allows users to upload a csv with a column heading of 'IP' and a list of ip addresses in the rows beneath that heading, one address per row.  The app will then enrich the IP addresses with whois information and allow the user to download the results. 

As of 18/04/21 this app is designed to be run on a windows desktop.  see requierments.txt for package requirements.
